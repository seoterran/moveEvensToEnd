# moveEvensToEnd

This solution takes a singly-linked list of Node objects containing integers, and modifies the list to move the even numbers to the end, preserving the order of the odds and the order of the evens. The complexity is O(1) in space and O(n) in time. For example, given 6, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 9, the result should be 3, 1, 1, 9, 6, 2, 4.
